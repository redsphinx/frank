Evaluation Options:

-h
	Output help information.
-t <name of training file>
	Sets training file.
-T <name of test file>
	Sets test file.
-x <number of folds>
	Do cross-validation with this many folds.
-R
	Randomize the order of instances in the dataset.
-split-percentage <percentage>
	Sets the percentage for the train/test set split, e.g., 66.
-split-number <number>
	Sets the number of training examples, e.g., 800
-i
	Invert the specified train/test split.
-s <random number seed>
	Sets random number seed (use with -R, for different CV or train/test splits).
-threshold <threshold>
	Sets the type of thresholding; where
		'PCut1' automatically calibrates a threshold (the default);
		'PCutL' automatically calibrates one threshold for each label;
		any number, e.g. '0.5', specifies that threshold.
-C <number of labels>
	Sets the number of target variables (labels) to assume (indexed from the beginning).
-d <classifier_file>
	Specify a file to dump classifier into.
-l <classifier_file>
	Specify a file to load classifier from.
-verbosity <verbosity level>
	Specify more/less evaluation output


Classifier Options:

-N
	Sets the number of RBMs
	default: 2
-H
	Sets the number of hidden units
	default: 10
-E
	Sets the maximum number of epochs
	default: 1000	(auto-cut-out)
-r
	Sets the learning rate (tyically somewhere between 'very small' and 0.1)
	default: 0.1
-m
	Sets the momentum (typically somewhere between 0.1 and 0.9)
	default: 0.1
-W
	Full name of base classifier.
	(default: weka.classifiers.trees.J48)
-output-debug-info
	If set, classifier is run in debug mode and
	may output additional info to the console
--do-not-check-capabilities
	If set, classifier capabilities are not checked before classifier is built
	(use with caution).
-

-D
	Do not use ADTree data structure

-B
	BIF file to compare with

-Q
	Search algorithm

-E
	Estimator algorithm

-output-debug-info
	If set, classifier is run in debug mode and
	may output additional info to the console
--do-not-check-capabilities
	If set, classifier capabilities are not checked before classifier is built
	(use with caution).
-

-N
	Initial structure is empty (instead of Naive Bayes)
-P
	Maximum number of parents
-R
	Random order.
	(default false)
-mbc
	Applies a Markov Blanket correction to the network structure, 
	after a network structure is learned. This ensures that all 
	nodes in the network are part of the Markov blanket of the 
	classifier node.
-S
	Score type (BAYES, BDeu, MDL, ENTROPY and AIC)
-

-A
	Initial count (alpha)
